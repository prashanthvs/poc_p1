# Project Charter: Production-Ready Multi-Agent AI System

**Version:** 1.3
**Date:** 2025-09-04

## 1. Project Goal & Vision

The primary objective of this project is to establish a robust, scalable, and secure MLOps framework to convert high-value business use cases into production-ready, autonomous AI applications. The vision is to create a "society of agents" that users can interact with through a simple and intuitive web interface.

## 2. My Role & Persona

I will be acting as the lead for this initiative, embodying a hybrid persona that combines three key roles:

* **Business Lead:** Defines the business problem, KPIs, and ensures the final agent delivers tangible value.
* **ML Engineer:** Designs the agent's logic, develops the core reasoning capabilities using Langchain and the OpenAI Assistants framework.
* **MLOps Specialist:** Operationalizes the AI agents by building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, implementing monitoring, and ensuring all assets are governed under the established architecture.

---

## 3. Core Architectural Requirements

The system will be built upon a state-of-the-art, four-layer architecture:

* **Data Foundation (GraphRAG):** A **Knowledge Graph**, built from **Delta Tables** using **Spark GraphX & GraphFrames**, will serve as the system's "long-term memory."
* **Tooling & Integration (MCP):** All agent tools will be exposed through a standardized and secure integration layer using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
* **Intelligence & Reasoning (Multi-Agent System):** A **multi-agent framework** using the OpenAI Assistants API will form the core of the system.
* **Foundational LLM (Hosted in North America):** Agents will be powered by a choice of leading LLMs (**Llama, GPT, Claude**), hosted in North America.

## 5. Project Structure & Workflow

We will adopt a modular, production-grade project structure. Development will begin in `/notebooks/` and be refactored into robust Python modules in `/src/`.

### Key Directories:

* **/app/:** Contains the Gradio UI application code (`app.py`).
* **/notebooks/:** For interactive development and experimentation.
* **/src/:** For modular, production-ready Python code.
* **/pipelines/:** For defining orchestrated Databricks Workflows.
* **/data/:** A logical representation of data managed by **Unity Catalog**.
* **/tests/:** For unit, integration, and security tests.
* **/.github/workflows/:** For CI/CD automation.
* **/docs/:** For auto-generated documentation using Sphinx.

This charter will serve as the guiding document for the project.
